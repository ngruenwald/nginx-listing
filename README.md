# nginx listing

Poor rebuild of <https://gitlab.com/devCoster/BetterListing>.

## Icons

Currently using the _Colloid_ icon theme (<https://store.kde.org/p/1661983>).
Extract _dark_ and _light_ icons into the _icons_ folder.


## TODOs

* [ ] test with real nginx installation
* [ ] finish the aesthetics
* [ ] adopt mimetype naming guides
  * <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html>
  * <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/shared-mime-info/-/tree/master/data>
* [ ] write usage guide
